     * Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
     * The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
     *
     * Note
     * The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
     * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer's binary representation.
     *
     * e.g
     * input->5, output->2
     * The binary representation of 5 is 101(no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
     * input->1, input->0
     * The binary representation of 1 is 1(no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

     * @return
