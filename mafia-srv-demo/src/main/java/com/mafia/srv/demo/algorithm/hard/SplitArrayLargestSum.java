     * [Hard]
     * Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m,
     * you can split the array into m non-empty continuous sub arrays.
     * White an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m sub arrays.
     *
     * Note. If n is the length of array, assume the following constrains are satisfied.
     * 1<=n<=1000, 1<=m<=min(50,n)
     *
     * e.g input->[7,2,5,10,8] m=2, output->18
     * There are four ways to split nums into two sub arrays.
     * The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two sub arrays is only 18.
     * @param nums
     * @param m
     * @return
