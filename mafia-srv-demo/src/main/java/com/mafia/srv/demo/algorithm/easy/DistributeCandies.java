     * The length of the given array in range [2,10000], and will be even.

     * e.g
     * input->[1,1,2,2,3,3], output->3
     * There are three different kinds of candies (1,2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
     * Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too.
     * The sister has three different kinds of candies.
     * input->[1,1,2,3], output->2
     * For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1].
     * The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies.
